This page is a curated collection of Jupyter/IPython notebooks that are notable.  Feel free to add new content here, but please try to only include links to notebooks that include interesting visual or technical content; this should *not* simply be a dump of a Google search on every ipynb file out there.

**Important contribution instructions:** If you add new content, please ensure that for any notebook you link to, the link is to the rendered version using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org), rather than the raw file.  Simply paste the notebook URL in the nbviewer box and copy the resulting URL of the rendered version.  This will make it much easier for visitors to be able to immediately access the new content.

Note that [Matt Davis](https://github.com/jiffyclub) has conveniently written a set of [bookmarklets and extensions](https://github.com/jiffyclub/open-in-nbviewer) to make it a one-click affair to load a Notebook URL into your browser of choice, directly opening into nbviewer.

## Notebooks in languages other than Python

These are notebooks that use [one of the IPython kernels for other languages](IPython kernels for other languages):

## Videos of IPython being used in the wild

Of course the first thing you might try is searching for videos about IPython (1900 or so by last count on Youtube) but there are demonstrations of other applications using the power of IPython but are not mentioned is the descriptions. Below are a few such:

* [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc16qeGBtMU) on how to learn Python featuring IPython as the platform of choice for learning!

* [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ONBVNm3isI) shows IPython being used in the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) project

* He does not show IPython in use but his IPython sticker is clear for the entire video: [Planning and Tending the Garden: The Future of Early Childhood Python Education](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op61s-QHryk)

* [Wes McKinney's speech](http://youtu.be/qbYYamU42Sw?t=5m9s) on Python and data analysis features IPython as does his book [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)

* [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG8FYPFU9n4) shows Plotly and IPython in use at a Montreal Python meetup.
